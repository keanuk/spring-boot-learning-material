# Lesson 1: Introduction
In this lesson we will cover the fundamentals of Spring Boot. We will discuss what it is used for, the tools and libraries that it is built upon, and we will create a demo application to showcase some of the basic functionality.

## What is Spring Boot used for?
Spring Boot is primarily used to create APIs (Application Programming Interface) that serve as an application's back end. It is frequently used by enterprises as an intermediary between a GUI (Graphical User Interface) application and a database.

## What is the Spring Framework?
The Spring Framework is a collection of libraries and configurations that take care of the more mundane tasks in creating a web application. It gained popularity because it significantly speeds up development time and abstracts some of the more difficult implementation details for back end applications.

#### Key Features and Concepts
- JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Handles connections to a database and provides an interface for sending queries to them

- AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming): 

## What is Spring Boot?
Spring Boot is a pre-configured setup of the Spring Framework. A Spring Boot application is still a Spring application, it just removes some of the setup and configuration by giving developers a set of 'sane' defaults to start with.

## Setting up a Spring Boot Application
We are going to create a sample REST API to showcase the process of creating a Spring Boot Application.
